    <p>So I decided to play around with node.js and ended up making a isketch clone.
Someone showed me isketch when I was a teen and I thought it was a really fun game
but I cant even play the game anymore because it requires shockwave so I decided to make a
HTML5 version.</p>

<p>So far its been really fun and people seem to enjoy it.</p>

<p>You can check it out <a href="http://drawaword.heroku.com">[here]</a></p>

<p>Source code is in my github, enjoy.</p>
