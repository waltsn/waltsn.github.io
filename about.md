I realized their is power in exercise, meditating, healthy eating, and yoga. I was able to destroy the inner voices of doubt, insecurities, and my depressive mood swings. I knew the final step of my self-discovery was to give back and help people who have similar mental battles. I knew I had to create a platform for a community, a one stop for all information on how to battle bad habits, physiology, inner turmoils that can be treated with just a simple addition of a positive mind, body and soul. I am Harshil Patel, founder of Fitsoul.life. Come join me on my journey. It's time to live more passionately.
