So I decided to play around with node.js and ended up making a isketch clone.
Someone showed me isketch when I was a teen and I thought it was a really fun game
but I cant even play the game anymore because it requires shockwave so I decided to make a
HTML5 version. 

So far its been really fun and people seem to enjoy it.

You can check it out [[here]](http://drawaword.heroku.com)

Source code is in my github, enjoy.
